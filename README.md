# Xamarin.Forms.AsyncImage
Image control with cache and spinner for Xamarin Forms

Solution is four files. 

- A FileCache which requires Read/Write (because it uses I/O).
- AsyncImage ViewControl which does all the rendering.
- The other two are an interface / implementation for image resizing (Use your own)

The solution is dead simple. Enjoy.
